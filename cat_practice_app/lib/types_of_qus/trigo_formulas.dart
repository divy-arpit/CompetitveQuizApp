/*
Sum of interior angles of a polygon of side- n =(n-2)180o
sum of exterior angles= 360
Area = (ns^2/4)Xcot(180/n), s= length of side, n= number of sides
Perimeter= nXs
Sum of all angles of x-point star = (x-4)180o
Sine rule= a/sin A= b/sin B= c/sin C= 2R (R=circum-raidus)
Cosine rule= a^2= b^2 + c^2 -2bc CosA
